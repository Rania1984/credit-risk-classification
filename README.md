# Credit Risk Analysis Report


## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in predicting the creditworthiness of potential borrowers in a peer-to-peer lending service. 

## Results

* Accuracy: 99%  this means the model correctly predicts loan status.
* Precision: 
 Healthy loans (0): 1.00  this means all predicted healthy loans were correct.  
 High-risk loans (1): 0.84 – this means 84% of predicted high-risk loans were actually high-risk.
* Recall: 
 Healthy loans (0): 0.99 – Nearly all actual healthy loans were correctly identified. 
 High-risk loans (1): 0.94 – The model successfully captured 94% of actual high-risk loans.


## Summary

I would recommend using this model to predict borrower creditworthiness because it has 99% accuracy in identifying loan risk. It correctly classifies healthy loans (0) with precision 1.00 and recall 0.99, while detecting high-risk loans (1) with recall 0.94. This model performs best because it balances high accuracy and strong recall, making it reliable for lenders.
